# Fix Log - SQLAlchemy Relationship Error

## Issue
```
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError
File "/mount/src/assessment-portal/src/database/__init__.py", line 138, in <module>
    class MonitoringEvent(Base):
        session = relationship("Session", back_populates="monitoring_events")
```

## Root Cause
SQLAlchemy 2.0+ has stricter relationship resolution. When using forward references with `back_populates`, the relationships need explicit lazy loading configuration to avoid initialization errors.

## Solution Applied
1. Added `lazy="select"` to all relationship definitions
2. This ensures SQLAlchemy can properly resolve forward-referenced relationships
3. Applied to all relationships in the models:
   - Recruiter.assessments
   - Assessment relationships (recruiter, questions, sessions, invitations)
   - Question relationships (assessment, responses)
   - Invitation.assessment
   - Session relationships (assessment, responses, monitoring_events)
   - Response relationships (session, question)
   - MonitoringEvent.session

## Changes Made
- Updated all `relationship()` calls to include `lazy="select"`
- Removed unnecessary `from __future__ import annotations`
- Removed unused `TYPE_CHECKING` imports

## Testing
The fix should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` when loading the database models. The relationships will now load lazily when accessed, preventing initialization errors.

## Deployment
- Branch: `develop`
- Status: Ready for testing on Streamlit Cloud
